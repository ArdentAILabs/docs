Ardent lets you create instant, isolated copies of your production Postgres database in under 6 seconds right in your terminal. 

Test migrations, run schema changes and let coding agents like Claude Code and Cursor actually test its database work — all against real data, without touching production so you know they work.

No more shared staging databases. No more writing seed scripts. No more seeding environments for agents. No more hoping your migration works. 

An instant database for every task.

## Get started in seconds

```bash
npm install -g ardent
ardent login
ardent connector create postgresql <your-connection-string>
ardent branch create my-feature
```

That's it. You can make full, isolated copies of your database — ready in under 6 seconds regardless of data size.

## How it works

Ardent replicates your production database into a read replica, then creates lightweight copy-on-write forks on demand. Each fork is a fully functional Postgres database with your real data — we call them **branches**, just like git.

We handle all the infrastructure under the hood so you just have to worry about building!

```
Production DB → Replication → Read replica → Instant fork → Your branch
```

The workflow mirrors what you already know from git:

- **`ardent branch create`** — spin up an isolated database copy
- **`ardent branch switch`** — switch between branches
- **`ardent branch diff`** — see what changed
- **`ardent branch delete`** — clean up when you're done

Branches auto-suspend after 5 minutes of inactivity and spin back up instantly on reconnect. Branches will not incur any storage cost either, only changes you make on the branches.

Create as many as you need, throw them away when you're done without worrying.
