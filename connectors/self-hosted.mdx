Any Postgres instance with logical replication enabled works with Ardent.

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable logical replication">

Set `wal_level = logical` in your `postgresql.conf`:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'logical';
```

Then restart Postgres for the change to take effect.

</Step>

<Step title="Check replication slots">

Make sure you have at least 1 available replication slot:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;
```

</Step>

<Step title="Grant replication permissions">

Ensure your user has the `REPLICATION` privilege:

```sql
ALTER USER your_user WITH REPLICATION;
```

</Step>

<Step title="Connect your database">

```bash
ardent connector create postgresql postgresql://user:password@your-host:5432/mydb
```

Ardent will verify your setup and begin replicating your database. This may take a few minutes depending on data size.

<Tip>
  Not sure if your database is ready? Just run the command — Ardent checks all prerequisites during setup and tells you what's missing.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Create your first branch">

```bash
ardent branch create my-feature
```

Done. You now have an isolated copy of your database — schema, data, and all. The CLI returns a connection URL you can use anywhere.

</Step>
