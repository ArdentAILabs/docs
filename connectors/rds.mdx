<Steps>
<Step title="Enable logical replication">

Create or modify a parameter group with `rds.logical_replication = 1` and apply it to your RDS instance.

<Warning>
  This requires a reboot of your RDS instance. Plan accordingly.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Grant replication permissions">

Connect to your RDS instance and grant the replication role to your user:

```sql
GRANT rds_replication TO your_user;
```

</Step>

<Step title="Get your connection string">

Your RDS connection string looks like:

```
postgresql://user:password@your-instance.region.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/mydb
```

You can find the hostname in the **RDS Console > Databases > your instance > Connectivity & security**.

</Step>

<Step title="Connect your database">

```bash
ardent connector create postgresql postgresql://user:password@your-instance.region.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/mydb
```

Ardent will verify your setup and begin replicating your database. This may take a few minutes depending on data size.

</Step>

<Step title="Create your first branch">

```bash
ardent branch create my-feature
```

Done. You now have an isolated copy of your RDS database — schema, data, and all. The CLI returns a connection URL you can use anywhere.

</Step>
