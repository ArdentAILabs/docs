Neon uses a bring-your-own-cloud (BYOC) model where Ardent instruments your existing Neon project to manage branching.

<Info>
  Neon already supports copy-on-write branching natively. Ardent layers on top of this to give you a CLI-first workflow, auto-suspend, and team management.

<Steps>
<Step title="Get your Neon API key">

In the Neon console, go to **Account Settings > API Keys** and create an API key.

</Step>

<Step title="Get your project ID">

Go to **Project Settings** in your Neon console and copy the project ID.

</Step>

<Step title="Connect your database">

```bash
ardent connector create postgresql --byoc neon --api-key <your-neon-api-key> --project-id <your-neon-project-id>
```

Ardent will verify your setup and instrument your Neon project.

</Step>

<Step title="Create your first branch">

```bash
ardent branch create my-feature
```

Done. You now have an isolated copy of your Neon database — schema, data, and all. The CLI returns a connection URL you can use anywhere.
