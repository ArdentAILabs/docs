<Steps>
<Step title="Enable the IPv4 add-on">

Ardent needs a direct connection to your database, which requires a dedicated IPv4 address.

In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Project Settings > Add-ons > IPv4 Address** and enable it. This is available on Pro plans and above ($4/month). No downtime required.

</Step>

<Step title="Enable logical replication">

Go to **Database > Replication** in your Supabase dashboard and enable replication.

</Step>

<Step title="Find your connection string">

Go to **Settings > Database > Connection string** in your Supabase dashboard. Copy the **direct connection** URI (not the pooled connection). It looks like:

```
postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

</Step>

<Step title="Connect your database">

```bash
ardent connector create postgresql postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

Ardent will verify your setup and begin replicating your database. This may take a few minutes depending on data size.

</Step>

<Step title="Create your first branch">

```bash
ardent branch create my-feature
```

Done. You now have an isolated copy of your Supabase database — schema, data, and all. The CLI returns a connection URL you can use anywhere.
