<Info>
  **Prerequisites:**
  - Node.js (LTS recommended)
  - A Postgres connection string (Supabase, RDS, Neon, or self-hosted)
</Info>

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the CLI">

```bash
npm install -g ardent
```

</Step>

<Step title="Log in">

```bash
ardent login
```

This opens your browser to authenticate with GitHub or email.

</Step>

<Step title="Connect your database">

```bash
ardent connector create postgresql postgresql://user:password@host:5432/mydb
```

Ardent replicates your database during initial setup. This may take some time depending on the size of your data — but you only do this once. After setup, every branch creates in under 6 seconds regardless of data size.

</Step>

<Step title="Create your first branch">

```bash
ardent branch create my-feature
```

Done. You now have an isolated copy of your production database. The CLI returns a connection string you can use anywhere — psql, your app, an ORM, or hand it to an agent.

</Step>
</Steps>

## What's next

- Feed the connection URL to Claude Code — test if your migration breaks, try a new index to see if it speeds up your queries, or let it write and validate schema changes against real data
- Try `ardent branch diff` to see what changed
- Create more branches for different tasks — they auto-suspend when idle, so don't worry about cleanup
